# North-Korean-Nuclear-Test

The apparent moment rate function (AMRF) obtained by the multi-taper spectrum analysis (Prieto et al., 2009). To remove the high frequency noise, the AMRF was bandpass filtered with a frequency of 0.01~20 Hz.

The empirical Green function for AMRF in amrf_wl_NKT4 is NKT4 and the empirical Green function for AMRF in amrf_wl_NKT5 is NKT5.

iris_download.py is a python script used to download waveform data from IRIS. The waveform data for NKT4-6 have been stored in three directories named after the origin time of those earthquakes.
